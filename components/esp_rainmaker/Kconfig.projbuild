            state and the same is reported to the ESP RainMaker Cloud during the User Node association

                Enable sunrise and sunset based schedules in ESP RainMaker.

                This feature allows JSON API support for scheduling based on
                astronomical calculations for sunrise and sunset times at specific
                geographical locations.

                Requires ESP_SCHEDULE_ENABLE_DAYLIGHT to be enabled.

                Disabling this option will:
                - Remove sunrise/sunset JSON API support
                - Save memory by excluding solar schedule parsing/generation code
                - Reduce binary size (by about 750 bytes. Disable CONFIG_ESP_SCHEDULE_ENABLE_DAYLIGHT for further saving of 11500 bytes)

                param values would be the same as those for activate, since the RainMaker core does not know what the

                This should be enabled only while testing commands, but should always be disabled in production firmware.
