# ESP RainMaker (Beta)

## Introduction

ESP RainMaker is an end-to-end solution offered by Espressif to enable remote control and monitoring for ESP32-S2 and ESP32 based products without any configuration required in the Cloud. The primary components of this solution are:

- Claiming Service (to get the Cloud connectivity credentials)
- RainMaker Agent (i.e. this repo, to develop the firmware)
- RainMaker Cloud (backend, offering remote connectivity)
- RainMaker Phone App/CLI (Client utilities for remote access)


The key features of ESP RainMaker are:

1. Ability to define own devices and parameters, of any type, in the firmware.
2. Zero configuration required on the Cloud.
3. Phone apps that dynamically render the UI as per the device information.
